# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Mostafa Mohamed Mahmoud Abdelghafaar


## Dataset

  This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

## Summary of Findings

	-The general purpose of the report is to explain in general terms about the individual trips that are made in the bike-sharing system that covers the Greater San Francisco Bay Area
	and to identify the factors that drive participants to participate in trips, what distinguishes some areas from others,
	the percentage of participation numbers of males and females, and the time spent Some spend it and some other factors that increase our knowledge of the factors that go into trips.
	-The duration variable took on a large range of values, so I looked at the data using a log transform. Under the transformation, the data looked bimodal,
	with one peak between 100 ùëéùëõùëë 1200, and anothers .
	-I noticed that although the number of Males is more than the number of Females, there are stations, which are among the top 10 stations in terms of the number of riders. 
	Females represent the largest proportion of the participants. Most of the participants are between the ages of 20 and 40, Take an average time of 1000 seconds. 
	Females also clearly take longer to race.
	-Here obvious that although the number of trips with higher duration is higher for males but some women around 60 years of age take a longer period of time.

## Key Insights for Presentation

	-Visualization about genders of participants
	This visualization show us that most of peoples are Males and The remainder nearly represent a quarter of the percentage of participants are females and others.
	-Visualization about genders at each station
	I noticed that although the number of Males is more than the number of Females, there are stations, which are among the top 10 stations in terms of the number of riders.
	Females represent the largest proportion of the participants.
	-Visualization between 3 variables genders and their ages and duration for each
	Here obvious that although the number of trips with higher duration is higher for males but some women around 60 years of age take a longer period of time.
